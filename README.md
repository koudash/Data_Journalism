# Homework-16_Data_Journalism
<p><strong>Health risks facing particular demographics</strong> have been plotted here based on <i>dataset for 2014 ACS 1-year estimates</i> (<a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml">https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml</a>). Three different risks (<strong>lack of healthcare, smoke, and obesity</strong>) were listed as y-axis of the chart with different colors when activated. Similarly, demographics categorized by three individual factors (<strong>poverty, age, and median household income</strong>) were plotted at x-axis, respectively, with different colors as well. Each circle in the chart represents an individual US. state. Circles are filled with the color of x-axis ticks and titles, whereas circle test color (state abbreviation) is reflecting y-axis ticks and titles. Titles of both x- and y-axis can be changed by simply clicking on that of interest. When doing that, a temporary circle with the color of selected title will be shown. All unselected (deactivated) titles will be “faded out” in gray color. Application is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed <a href="https://koudash-datajournalism.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
