# Homework-16_Data_Journalism
**Health risks facing particular demographics** have been plotted here based on <i>dataset for 2014 ACS 1-year estimates</i> (<a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml">https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml</a>). Three different risks (**lack of healthcare, smoke, and obesity**) were listed as y-axis of the chart with different colors when activated. Similarly, demographics categorized by three individual factors (**poverty, age, and median household income**) were plotted at x-axis, respectively, with different colors as well. Each circle in the chart represents an individual US. state. Circles are filled with the color of x-axis ticks and titles, whereas circle test color (state abbreviation) is reflecting y-axis ticks and titles. Titles of both x- and y-axis can be changed by simply clicking on that of interest. When doing that, a temporary circle with the color of selected title will be shown. All unselected (deactivated) titles will be “faded out” in gray color.
